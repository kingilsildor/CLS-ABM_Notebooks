    "# Agent Based Modeling - Mesa\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is an agent-based modeling framework in Python. Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations, visualize them using a browser-based interface, and analyze their results using Python’s data analysis tools.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook is based on and uses parts of texts from the Mesa docs._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretised Lotka Volterra\n",
    "In this notebook we aim to familiarise you with Mesa and its Object Oriented Programming approach to agent-based models. This will be done through implementation of a simplified preditor-prey model (discretised Lotka Volterra). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not yet comfortable with Object Oriented Programming or need a refresher, please visit [this page](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a version of the \"sheep-wolf\" model wherein wolves and sheep wander randomly around the landscape. To allow the population to grow, each wolf or sheep has a fixed probability of reproducing at each timestep. In this simplified version, sheep do not have to eat, and only die when eaten by a wolf. Wolves, however, have a probability of dying. This produces interesting population dynamics, but creates a model that is ultimately unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we need the following:\n",
    "- **Agents:** the predators and preys\n",
    "- **Environment:** an area in which the predators and prey can move around and interact\n",
    "- **Model:** the controller that links the environment and the agents\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already implemented the model and the environment is already implemented by Mesa, but it is up to you to implement the Agents!"

    "### The model\n",
    "Now that you have implemented the agents, we will introduce you to the model. The model links the agents to the environment and provides methods that make interactions with the model easy. It uses the `DataCollector` class, which we will explain later, and the `RandomActivation` class. The `RandomActivation` class is a scheduler that iterates through each of the agents randomly and uses its `step()` method. We have seperated the Sheep scheduler from the Wolf scheduler to prevent what is called a [\"race-condition\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) wherein a Sheep gets eaten before it is its turn to `step()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing of this notebook, there are 4 different schedulers available in Mesa:\n",
    "- `BaseScheduler`: This is a scheduler that activates agents one at a time, in the order they were added.\n",
    "- `RandomActivation`: Activates each agent once per step, in random order, with the order reshuffled every step.\n",
    "- `SimultaneousActivation`: Activates all agents simultaneously.\n",
    "- `StagedActivation`: Allows agent activation to be divided into several stages instead of a single `step` method.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data collector\n",
    "So far, we have tested the model by checking variables manually. This is not very efficient, and requires us to make complicated loops if we need more than just the end results. Mesa provides a class which can handle the data collection and storage. This class was already added to the model above; `DataCollector`. From the Mesa docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The data collector stores three categories of data: model-level variables, agent-level variables, and tables (which are a catch-all for everything else). Model- and agent-level variables are added to the data collector along with either the name of an attribute that the agents or models have, or a function for collecting some data. Model-level collection functions take a model object as an input, while agent-level collection functions take an agent object as an input. Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector’s collect method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model. Similarly, the method applies each agent-level collection function to each agent currently in the schedule, associating the resulting value with the step of the model, and the agent’s unique_id.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply said, the `DataCollector` adds data to its dictionary when you call `collect()` method. We have added two functions that keep track of the amount of Sheep and Wolf to the `DataCollector` and call collect after each `step()` that the model makes.\n",

    "See if you can make a similar plot which displays the average number of sheep a wolf has eaten over its lifetime for each `step()` in the model. You will need to change the `step()` method of the wolf so that it counts every sheep it has eaten, and you will need to change the `DataCollector` to log this data. You can then use `model.datacollector.get_agent_vars_dataframe()` to get your data.\n",

    "### Visualisation\n",
    "Mesa provides you with an interactive visualisation toolkit. This is done through a local server that uses JavaScript to draw  everything in a browser window. An advantage of this is that we can run models step by step, spotting patterns, behaviors, bugs, developing new intuitions, hypotheses or insights. It is also a very good way to explain a model to your roommates or grandparents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided you with a seperate `server.py` that shows you how you could visualise this model, as the visualisation will not cooperate with notebooks. Feel free to take a look and change elements to get accustomed to how the visualisation module works. For more information, visit [this link](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/visualization_tutorial.html#building-your-own-visualization-component).\n",

    "`> ipython server.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Keep in mind that the \"Frames Per Second\" setting does not take into account the time it takes to build a frame. This means that when your simulation takes more time to build a frame than it takes the visualisation to display it, and you press stop, the visualisation will continue untill it has displayed all the frames that it should have displayed in the first place. To prevent this from happening, do not set \"Frames Per Second\" too high."

    "### Mesa best practices\n",
    "To ensure that our models are easily accessible and maintainable, Mesa provides us with some general principles. These principles can be found [here](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices.html), but the main take-away is that you should structure your files. The model class for example, should be located in `model.py` and generally, the agents should be located in `agent.py`.\n"
